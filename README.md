# My Portfolio

## What is this Project?

This is the GitHub repository for my portfolio, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It is hosted at http://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~zm83483, and I set up my [GitHub Pages](https://zmuranaka.github.io) to redirect there as well.

## Directories:

images  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This folder contains the social media logos, arrow images, burger nav icons, and video posters.  
scripts  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This folder contains the JavaScript scripts that handle everything from how elements are displayed to how the smooth scroll functions. It also contains the PHP that allows the email contact form to work.  
styles  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This folder contains the stylesheet for the website.  
videos  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This folder contains the videos showcasing my projects.

## Sources:

I got the GitHub logo from [GitHub](https://github.com/logos), I got the Handshake logo from
[Handshake](https://weber.joinhandshake.com), and I created the arrow images, burger nav icons, and mail logo in Adobe Photoshop.  
Websites that helped me create the project:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q0gYjAVonI  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This YouTube video taught me how to create a functional email contact form with PHP.  
https://css-tricks.com/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website was very helpful for anything CSS-related, whether checking syntax or learning something new.  
https://www.w3schools.com/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W3Schools was very helpful when I was checking that my syntax was correct and as a general reference.
